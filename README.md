README: DartLung - Infant Respiration Simulation Model
A Web-Based Tool for Training and Analyzing Infant Ventilation Mechanics

Overview
Tracheal intubation in 1-3 month-old infants is a high-risk procedure due to their immature physiology, rapid oxygen desaturation, and susceptibility to hypoxia, aspiration, and airway collapse. Clinicians must act swiftly and precisely, yet current training methods lack realistic simulations of infant respiratory responses, leading to increased procedural risks and ethical concerns.

DartLung is a groundbreaking respiration simulation model designed to address these challenges. It provides a realistic, web-based platform for simulating the respiratory mechanics of infants aged 1-3 months, enabling clinicians and researchers to analyze respiratory patterns, test intubation scenarios, and improve clinical outcomes in a safe, controlled environment.

By leveraging customizable input parameters and real-time physiological feedback, DartLung empowers healthcare professionals to make informed decisions, reduce procedural risks, by enhancing training standards in pediatric care.

Key Features
User-Friendly Web Interface: Accessible from any browser, no installation required.
Real-Time Simulation: Mimics infant respiratory mechanics with high fidelity.
Customizable Inputs: Adjust parameters such as lung compliance, airway resistance, and ventilator settings.
Predictive Modeling: Input patient-specific data (age, weight, length, sex) to simulate spontaneous breathing and predict oxygen desaturation timelines.
Graphical Visualizations: View real-time respiratory waveforms, pressure-volume loops, and flow-time curves.
Critical Time Analysis: Monitor blood oxygen saturation levels and determine the time limit for successful intubation.
Data Export: Download simulation results in CSV or PNG format for further analysis.

Why DartLung?
The Problem
Infants aged 1-3 months are highly vulnerable during intubation due to their underdeveloped respiratory systems.
Existing training tools fail to adequately simulate infant physiology, leading to inadequate preparation and increased risks.
Ethical and practical constraints limit the ability to collect real-world data from this population.
The Solution
DartLung bridges this gap by providing a realistic, risk-free simulation environment that:
Enhances clinician training and preparedness.
Reduces procedural risks and associated healthcare costs.
Supports research and innovation in pediatric respiratory care.
